# Checkout Modal Fixes - Complete Summary

## ✅ All 4 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Form Going Behind Header - FIXED ✅

**Problem:** Modal z-index was too low (z-50), causing it to appear behind the header.

**Solution:**
- Changed backdrop z-index from `z-50` to `z-[9999]`
- Changed modal z-index from `z-50` to `z-[9999]`

**Result:** Form now appears above all other elements including the header.

---

### Issue 2: Premium Button Changed to "Chat With Us" - FIXED ✅

**Problem:** Premium tier should show "Chat With Us" instead of "Place Order".

**Solution:**
- Conditional button text based on tier
- Premium: "Chat With Us"
- Basic/Standard: "Place Order"

**Code:**
```tsx
{tier === 'premium' ? 'Chat With Us' : 'Place Order'}
```

**Result:** Premium tier button now says "Chat With Us" ✅

---

### Issue 3: Secondary "Chat With Us" Button for Basic/Standard - FIXED ✅

**Problem:** Basic and Standard tiers needed an additional "Chat With Us" button below "Place Order".

**Solution:**
- Added secondary button for Basic/Standard tiers
- Primary button: "Place Order" (black background)
- Secondary button: "Chat With Us" (white background, black border)
- Hidden for Premium tier

**Code:**
```tsx
{(tier === 'basic' || tier === 'standard') && (
  <Button
    type="button"
    onClick={(e) => handleSubmit(e, 'chat')}
    className="w-full bg-white text-gray-900 border-2 border-gray-900"
  >
    Chat With Us
  </Button>
)}
```

**Result:** 
- Basic: "Place Order" + "Chat With Us" buttons ✅
- Standard: "Place Order" + "Chat With Us" buttons ✅  
- Premium: "Chat With Us" button only ✅

---

### Issue 4: All Submissions Linked to Database & Admin Panel - FIXED ✅

**Problem:** Need all submissions (orders and chat requests) to save to database and show in admin panel.

**Solution:**

#### 1. Updated Inquiry Model ✅
Added fields to support checkout data:
- `tier`: 'basic' | 'standard' | 'premium'
- `price`: number
- `currency`: 'INR' | 'USD'
- `type`: 'order' | 'chat'
- `messages`: array of messages
- All client info fields

#### 2. Updated API Endpoint ✅
`/api/inquiries` now handles:
- Order submissions (`type: 'order'`)
- Chat requests (`type: 'chat'`)
- Saves all data to database
- Returns success message

#### 3. CheckoutModal Integration ✅
- Sends data to `/api/inquiries` instead of `/api/orders`
- Includes `type` field ('order' or 'chat')
- Formats message appropriately
- Redirects to WhatsApp after submission
