# Fix Summary: Null Reference Error

## ❌ Error You Encountered

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'title')
at ServicePage (app/[city]/[service]/ServicePageContent.tsx:77:49)
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

The error occurred because:
1. **No city/service pages existed in the database** yet
2. The component tried to access `service.title` when `service` was `null`
3. Pages need to be generated after seeding services and cities

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Added Null Safety Checks
Updated `ServicePageContent.tsx` to handle missing data gracefully:
- Added null checks for `service` and `city`
- Shows user-friendly error message if data is missing
- Prevents crashes when pages aren't generated

### 2. Created Automated Setup
Added complete database seeding with:
- **6 Services** with comprehensive pricing tiers (Basic, Standard, Premium)
- **6 Indian Cities** (Pune, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Delhi, Chennai)
- **Admin user** for dashboard access

### 3. Auto-Generate Pages Script
Created `scripts/generate-all-pages.ts` that automatically:
- Generates 36 city/service combination pages
- Creates SEO-optimized content for each page
- Marks cities as having pages generated

### 4. One-Command Setup
Added npm script for instant setup:
```bash
npm run setup
```

## 🚀 How to Fix Your Error

**Simple Solution - Run:**
```bash
npm run setup
```

This single command will:
1. ✅ Populate database with all services and cities
2. ✅ Generate all 36 city/service pages
3. ✅ Create admin user
4. ✅ Fix the null reference error

```bash
# Step 1: Seed database
