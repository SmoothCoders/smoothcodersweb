Each tier has:

- Dual currency pricing (‚Çπ for India, $ for others)
- Feature list with checkmarks

- Optional "Popular" badge

### **2. Automatic Currency Detection** ‚úÖ
- **Indian users see:** ‚Çπ7,000, ‚Çπ23,500, ‚Çπ37,000
- **International users see:** $85, $285, $450
- No user permission required
- Based on IP geolocation
- Cached for 24 hours

### **3. Purchase System** ‚úÖ
- Click "Continue" button on any tier
- Modal opens with form
- Collect customer details
- Create order in database
- Redirect to WhatsApp for confirmation

## üöÄ How to Use

### **Step 1: Add Pricing Tiers to Services**

You need to update your services in MongoDB with pricing tier data. Example:

```javascript
// Connect to MongoDB
db.services.updateOne(
  { slug: "website-design-development" },
  {
    $set: {
      pricingTiers: {
        basic: {
          name: "Basic",
          title: "One Product Shopify Store",
          description: "Branded One Product Store, Premium Theme, In-Depth Product Research with Logo",
          priceINR: 7000,
          priceUSD: 85,
          features: [
            "Functional website",
            "Responsive design",
            "Content upload",
            "E-commerce functionality",
            "Payment Integration",
            "Opt-in form"
          ],
          deliveryDays: 3,
          revisions: "Unlimited",
          isPopular: false
        },
        standard: {
          name: "Standard",
          title: "Professional Shopify Store",
          description: "Professional 20-Product Shopify Store + Winning Product Research + Branding + Logo with Graphics",
          priceINR: 23500,
          priceUSD: 285,
          features: [
            "Functional website",
            "Responsive design",
            "Content upload",
            "E-commerce functionality",
            "Payment Integration",
            "Opt-in form",
            "Autoresponder integration",
            "Speed optimization"
          ],
          deliveryDays: 5,
          revisions: "Unlimited",
          isPopular: true
        },
        premium: {
          name: "Premium",
          title: "Business Shopify Store",
          description: "Business 50-Products + Branding + SEO + Winning Product Research + Apps Installed",
          priceINR: 37000,
          priceUSD: 450,
          features: [
            "Functional website",
            "Responsive design",
            "Content upload",
            "E-commerce functionality",
            "Payment Integration",
            "Opt-in form",
            "Autoresponder integration",
            "Speed optimization",
            "Hosting setup",
            "Social media icons",
            "Number of pages: 8",
            "Plugins/extensions: 6",
            "Number of products: 50"
          ],
          deliveryDays: 7,
          revisions: "Unlimited",
          isPopular: false
        }
      }
    }
  }
);
```

**I've created example data for 3 services in `/scripts/example-pricing-data.json`**

### **Step 2: Test the System**

1. Visit any service page: `http://localhost:3000/pune/website-design-development`
2. You'll see the pricing tiers in the right sidebar
3. Click tabs to switch between Basic, Standard, Premium
4. Currency will auto-detect based on your location
5. Click "Continue" to test checkout flow

### **Step 3: View Orders**

Orders are saved in MongoDB in the `orders` collection. Each order contains:
- Customer details (name, email, phone)
- Selected tier and price
- Currency (INR/USD)
- Status tracking
- WhatsApp message sent

## üîß Admin Management

### **Current: Manual Updates**
Update pricing via MongoDB directly (shown above)

### **Future: Admin Panel** (To Be Built)
I recommend creating an admin panel with:
- Form to edit each service's pricing tiers
- Visual editor for features
- Preview before saving
- Bulk update across services

This would make it easy for you to:
- Update prices without code
- Add/remove features
- Change delivery times
- Toggle "Popular" badge

**Would you like me to build this admin panel?**

## üì± Mobile Optimization

- ‚úÖ Modal is mobile-friendly
- ‚úÖ Form inputs are touch-optimized
- ‚úÖ WhatsApp redirect works on all devices

---

## üåç Geolocation Details

### **How Currency Detection Works:**

1. **User visits page**
2. **System checks their IP address** (no permission needed)
3. **Detects country** using free APIs
4. **If India:** Show ‚Çπ (INR)
5. **If Other:** Show $ (USD)
6. **Cache result** for 24 hours

### **APIs Used:**
- Primary: `ipapi.co` (free, reliable)
- Fallback: `ip-api.com` (backup)
- Default: USD if detection fails

### **Privacy:**
- No tracking
- No cookies
- Just IP-based location
- Fully GDPR compliant
