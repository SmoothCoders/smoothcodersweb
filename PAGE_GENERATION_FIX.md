# 🎉 Page Generation Issue - FIXED!

**Date:** October 31, 2025 at 2:44 AM IST  
**Status:** ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

---

## 🔍 Problem Identified

When clicking "Generate Pages" for a city, the system showed "Pages Generated" but **no actual pages were created**. The API returned 200 but with 0 pages generated and 6 errors.

### Root Cause Analysis

**Error:** `"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toLowerCase')"`

**Location:** `lib/utils/seo-generator.ts` line 97

**Issue:** The SEO generator was trying to access `service.category.toLowerCase()` but:
- Services in the database don't have the `category` field populated
- The field exists in the model but wasn't set during service creation
- No fallback/null check was implemented

---

## 🛠️ Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Fixed SEO Generator Category Issue

**File:** `lib/utils/seo-generator.ts`

**Changes Made:**
```typescript
// Before (Line 90-93)
const serviceName = service.title;
const cityName = city.name;
const stateName = city.state;

// After
const serviceName = service.title;
const cityName = city.name;
const stateName = city.state;
const category = service.category || 'digital'; // ✅ Added fallback
```

**Additional Fixes:**
- Line 54: Changed `${service.category} ${cityName}` to conditional spread
- Line 166: Added fallback `${service.category || 'digital solutions'}`

### 2. ✅ Fixed Next.js 15 Params Promise Issue

**File:** `app/[city]/[service]/page.tsx`

**Problem:** Next.js 15/16 requires params to be awaited as they are now Promises

**Before:**
```typescript
params: { city: string; service: string }
const slug = `${params.city}/${params.service}`;
```

**After:**
```typescript
params: Promise<{ city: string; service: string }>
const { city, service } = await params;
const slug = `${city}/${service}`;
```

**Applied to:**
- `generateMetadata()` function (Line 8-20)
- `Page()` component (Line 61-73)

### 3. ✅ Fixed TypeScript Errors

**Issue:** Populated fields had incorrect type inference

**Fix:** Added proper type casting for populated serviceId field
```typescript
const serviceData = page.serviceId as any;
const imageUrl = serviceData?.image || '/og-image.jpg';
```
