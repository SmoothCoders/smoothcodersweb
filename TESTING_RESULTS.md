## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Issue: MongoDB Atlas IP Whitelist
**Error Message:**
```
Could not connect to any servers in your MongoDB Atlas cluster. 
One common reason is that you're trying to access the database 
from an IP that isn't whitelisted.
```

**Affected Routes:**
- All routes that query the database (Services, Cities, etc.)
- Admin API endpoints
- Public API endpoints that fetch data

**Working Routes:**
- Static pages that don't require database
- Authentication session check (doesn't hit MongoDB directly)

---

## 🛠️ Required Fixes

### Priority 1: Fix MongoDB Connection

**Option A: Whitelist Current IP (Recommended for Development)**
1. Go to MongoDB Atlas Dashboard
2. Navigate to Network Access
3. Click "Add IP Address"
4. Add your current IP or use `0.0.0.0/0` for development (⚠️ NOT for production)

**Option B: Update Connection String**
1. Verify the connection string in `.env.local`
2. Ensure credentials are correct
3. Check if cluster is active

**Option C: Add Fallback Handling**
- Implement better error handling in API routes
- Add retry logic for MongoDB connections
- Cache database responses when possible
